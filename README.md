# Stochastic Processes 

**Python, R, C++, and Jupyter Notebook** code used for solving different problems using **Monte Carlo Simulations**, problems will include estimating some kind of **distribution** of event, or **difficult high-dimensional quantities**. 
**_Monte Carlo Methods_** are a broad class of **computational algorithms** that rely on **repeated random sampling** to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to **use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle** They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.

**_Python Program_** using **_Object Oriented Design_** used to solve the classical **_probability_** problem **_Monty Hall Problem_**. I simmulate the results using **_Monte Carlo Methods_**
