# Monte-Carlo-Simulations

**_Python, C++, and Jupyter Notebook_** code used for solving different problems using **_Monte Carlo Simulations_**, problems will include estimating some kind of **_distribution_** of event. 
**_Monte Carlo Methods_** are a broad class of **_computational algorithms_** that rely on **_repeated random sampling_** to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to **_use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle_** They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.

**_Python Program_** using **_Object Oriented Design_** used to solve the classical **_probability_** problem **_Monty Hall Problem_**. I simmulate the results using **_Monte Carlo Methods_**
